# MermaidJS Diagram Collection

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of diagrams created with MermaidJS. These diagrams cover a variety of topics and demonstrate the versatility of MermaidJS.

## Structure

The main diagrams are as follows:

- `figure-subgraph.md`: This diagram uses subgraphs to represent complex relationships and hierarchies.
- `flowchart-color.md`: This diagram showcases how to use color in flowcharts to improve readability and convey additional information.
- `flowchart-subgraph-selfstady.md`: This diagram combines the use of subgraphs and flowcharts to represent a self-study process.
- `gantt.md`: This diagram is a Gantt chart representing a project timeline.

## How to Use

To view a diagram, navigate to the appropriate markdown (`.md`) file and open it. The MermaidJS syntax used to create the diagram will be displayed, and you can view the rendered diagram if your markdown viewer supports MermaidJS.
